            <h2>Why Teen Patti is a Must-Try in 2025</h2>
            <p>Teen Patti, also known as Indian Poker, remains a cultural favorite in India, especially during festivals like Diwali. Its simple rules and thrilling betting rounds make it accessible to beginners while offering depth for strategic players. In 2025, online platforms like Teen Patti Stars have elevated the game with exciting variations such as Muflis, Sudden Death, and 999, alongside live dealer options.</p>
            <p>The game typically involves 2 to 5 players, each dealt three cards from a deck of 106 (excluding the small king). Players compete to form the best hand, ranked as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trail/Trio/Set:</strong> Three cards of the same rank (e.g., three Aces).</li>
                <li><strong>Pure Sequence:</strong> Three consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 4-5-6 of hearts).</li>
                <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> Three consecutive cards, not all in the same suit.</li>
                <li><strong>Color/Flush:</strong> Three cards of the same suit, not in sequence.</li>
                <li><strong>Pair:</strong> Two cards of the same rank.</li>
                <li><strong>High Card:</strong> Three cards that don’t form any of the above.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Teen Patti’s social aspect, combined with its online accessibility, has made it a global phenomenon.
